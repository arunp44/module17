# REGEX (an intro)

Introduction to regex. A brief explination.

## Summary

A regular expression, commonly referred to as regex or regexp, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is mainly used for text-based searching and string manipulation.
Regular expressions are often used in web development to validate user input or find specific strings of characters within larger blocks of text. They are also widely used in data science, natural language processing, and text analytics.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors match the starting and ending points of a string or line. For example, you can use ^ to match the beginning of a string, and $ to match the end of a string.
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers allow you to specify how many of a character or character class should be matched. For example, you can use * to match zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or character class, or + to match one or more occurrences of the preceding character or character class.
### OR Operator

### Character Classes

### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing
Groups allow you to match a pattern multiple times within a string, and backreferences allow you to refer back to previously matched groups.
### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Lookaheads and lookbehinds are another powerful tool available in regex. They allow you to check for a certain pattern before or after the main expression without actually including it in the match.
